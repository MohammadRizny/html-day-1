      <h2>My Full Stack Web Development Journey</h2>
      <p>My journey into full stack web development began with a curiosity about how websites and web applications
        functioned. I started by learning the basics of HTML and CSS, which laid the foundation for understanding web
        structure and design. As I progressed, I delved into JavaScript to add interactivity to my projects.

        Eager to expand my skill set, I explored front-end frameworks like React and Vue.js, which allowed me to build
        dynamic user interfaces more efficiently. Simultaneously, I began learning back-end technologies such as
        Node.js
        and Express.js to understand server-side development and database management.

        Throughout this journey, I've worked on various projects that challenged me to apply my knowledge in
        real-world
        scenarios. From creating simple portfolio websites to developing full-fledged web applications, each project
        has
        contributed to my growth as a developer.

        I'm committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends and best practices.
        My goal is to become a proficient full stack developer capable of delivering high-quality web solutions that
        meet user needs and business objectives.</p>

        <summary><strong>Why Am I learning full stack development?</strong></summary>
        <p>I am learning full-stack development with discipline because I believe consistency, structure, and daily
          practice are the foundations of real skill. Full-stack development allows me to understand how complete
          web
          applications work—from designing user interfaces to managing servers, databases, and application logic. By
          following a disciplined learning routine, I am building strong problem-solving abilities, writing clean
          and
          efficient code, and developing the mindset of a professional developer. This approach helps me stay
          focused,
          overcome challenges, and continuously improve, with the long-term goal of becoming a reliable full-stack
          developer who can create scalable, real-world solutions.</p>
