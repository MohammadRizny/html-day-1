# HTML Day 1 – Semantic Structure

## Overview
This project is part of my full-stack development journey.
The goal of Day 1 is to build a clean semantic HTML structure
and build the habit of daily execution.

## What I Built
- Semantic HTML page
- Header with navigation
- Main content with sections and article
- Contact form
- Footer

## HTML Concepts Used
- Semantic tags: header, nav, main, section, article, footer
- Basic form elements
- Clean document structure

## Daily Discipline
Even under pressure, I showed up and executed.
No zero day.

## Next Step
Start CSS fundamentals and layout.
